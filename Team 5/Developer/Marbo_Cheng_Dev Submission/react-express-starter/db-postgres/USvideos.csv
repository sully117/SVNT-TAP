Some in Silicon Valley are even calling for a basic minimum income provided by the government for everyone, under the assumption that work will become scarce. But many economists are skeptical of these claims, because the notion that the the economy offers a fixed amount of work has been debunked time and time again over the centuries and current economic data show no signs of a productivity boom. Fortunately, we don't need to divine the future of the labor market in order to prepare for it. \n\n///\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure there’s nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\n\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar? I know producers have a lot to do with making the movie but we all agree that the movie is the directors VISION. Do you think that the director should get awarded as well?\n\nJessica McNeil - Hi John! The BF and I watch the show everyday when we get home from work. Thanks for all you do! With Justice League reactions now out there, how should we feel? I’ve been excited for the movie but don’t know how to take the limited reactions I’ve been seeing. Help.\n\nPATREON Supporter Jason Kaiser - You mentioned that Disney was in talks to buy Fox in order to compete with Netflix. If that’s the case, why doesn’t Disney just forget about Fox and just buy Netflix?\n\nAlfred Agcaoili - Aloha John. Big fan of your show. Now that the first reactions by movie critics have come out for The Justice League, do you still believe that it will become the #1 comic book movie of 2017 and join the Billion Dollar Club?"

It was inspired by a painting called ‘The Dance Of Life’ by one of my favorite artists, Edvard Munch. It’s an illustration of three women—one in white, one in red and one in black—and tells a story about three stages of human life: youth, maturity, and old age. I was always drawn to this image as a kid due to its simple symbolism and emotion and have been dying to do a video that could reflect on it.

So sorry! I️t will be back up and running soon! \n\nAs some of you may know, I lost my dad to kidney cancer almost 5 years ago. It has been a traumatic and grief filled world for me for so many reasons. Simply put, he was my dad. He was the main man in my life for almost all of my life and really ruled at it. I miss him every single day. More recently, really since Sonny was born, I find myself missing him more and more. It’s unfortunate how such amazing times in ones life, like getting married or having a baby, can be colored with such darkness. Again, I hate to be a total downer, but this is the reality of so many of our lives. This doesn’t mean we love our husbands or our babies or even our whole lives any less, it’s just that it’s difficult to fully feel pure happiness at these momentous occasions. Sometimes I’m ridden with the simple thought of how much better life would be with my dad and that just makes me so sad. Once I  get to that dark place though, my mind has the ability to take a turn and see not only how lucky I am for what I have, but how lucky I was to have a parent that taught me how to be a good parent in return. In this Chapter of I Love My Baby, But I Miss My Dad, we cover missing my dad, honoring my dad and passing on the lessons he taught me so his legacy lives on and on and on. He deserves that. I’d love to know how any of you out there who have lost parents have taught your children about them and kept the spirit of them alive. Comment below. Love you all.\n\nMusic Used: \nAvocado Street\nGymnopedie No1\nReflection Pool\nLife in Romance\nSimple Story"

The most recent “Rip it Up” charted at #3, whilst their recent live concert film “All You Can Eat” charted at #1 and their touring included a UK arena tour and numerous concerts across the world.\n\n “Christmas Day” is more a timeless ballad than a traditional festive carol, and reveals the band in a new light. \nThe heartfelt, melancholic song features a stunning and evocative arrangement from guitarist Luke Morley to accompany the unique voice of singer Danny Bowes.\nThe single is released in some highly collectable formats with exclusive additional songs released on CD for the 1st time.\nThey include a new version of Thunder classic “Love Walked In”, which appears in a new re-recorded and mostly acoustic arrangement, the classic “Low Life In High Places“  featuring  similar treatment as does the more recent song “Heartbreak Hurricane“.\n\n“Christmas Day” is released as CD Digipak and Digital on December 1st, 2017 on earMUSIC.\nThe official Thunder store also offers a wide variety of exclusive, limited fan items and bundles, including a 7inch 2-track vinyl as well as a coloured 10inch 4-track vinyl.\n\nPREORDER “CHRISTMAS DAY” HERE:\n► Official webstore: https://thunder.tmstor.es\n► CD: http://smarturl.it/Thunder_Christmas_CD\n► iTunes: http://smarturl.it/Thunder_Christmas_iT\nThunder will be Alice Cooper's special Guest on his German tour in November.\nOn December 15th and 16th Thunder perform their annual Christmas show in Wolverhampton.
