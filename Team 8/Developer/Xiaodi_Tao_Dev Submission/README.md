There are two folders, first one is the script for database(Mysql),
second one is the spring boot backend application for restful apis.

springboot-backend-api
Description:
This this the backend part for the prediction of Youtube. I designed the backend restful apis for the application. Both the user api and prediction api.

Requirements
For building and running the application you need:

JDK 1.8
Maven 4.0.0
Spring 2.2.0
Mysql 8.0.17

Running the application locally
There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the main method in the src/main/java/com.javaxiaodi.springapi.SpringapiApplication class from your IDE.

Please have Mysql Server running, and edit the database connection configuration in src/main/resources/application.properties
